Our experience in solving a problem by using a computer always involve the idea that we have access to the data at the same time that you can define some specific rules that can be used to map
an asswer. From a programming perspective, you need to create a series of rules that guarantee that given the input you will get the correct output. As the diversity of input and ouput makes this programming scheme to fail. A different approach is based on allowing the machine to learn, which means that experience will be used to make accurate predictions. This paradigm can be summarized as:
