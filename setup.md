title: Introduction to Machine Learning
---
The lesson on machine learning is based on Python. We recommend either using your own machine or access to a HPC cluster to follow the examples and work on the exercises.

The computer must have a working Python 3.6 or 3.7. In addition to the Python interpreter a number of scientific and machine-learning specific packages are needed.

You will need the following packages in recent versions:

numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipython, pandas, networx, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras and pytorch.
